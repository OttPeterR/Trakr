this was my senior project in Spring 2017.

It analyzes network traffic and logs MAC addresses to guage the number of people who come and go from a location.
It's got a config file to mess with some paramters.

Processing the data takes too long, so my setup was to have a raspberry pi do the capturing (it's cheap and I could leave it pluggged in somewhere for a few days) and then a main computer/laptop/whatever to process the data and create the totals of how many people were present for each x minutes section of time.
