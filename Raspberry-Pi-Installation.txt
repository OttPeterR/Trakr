How to run TRAKr

first we need a few things in order for TRAKr to start running

We'll need tshark, the terminal verison of Wireshark to do packet capture.

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install tshark


Then, some python dependencies are needed. Pip is a package manager for python, and pyCLI is the command line interface TRAKr uses.

	sudo apt-get install python-pip
	sudo pip install pyCLI

Now you're all ready to run. If you want to do any wireless packet capture, it must be run as sudo like so:

	sudo python TRAKr.py -scan

Or any other operations can be done as a standard user

	python TRAKr.py -load /path/to/file.pcap
