Install some other things we need for Python

Put TRAKr in a directory
cd into it

before you run it, you might want to tweak some of the settings in the
trakr.ini file. Most importantly, the wireless interface. There's a
good chance that your wifi module is wlan1 instead of the default en0

Run TRAKr

	This will do everything for you all in one command:
	Scan, analysze, save to database.

	sudo python TRAKr.py -run

Get your juicy analytics:

	A second instance of TRAKr may be run if one is already scanning.
	This second isntance will interface with the database and get
	your metrics from it. Most of its output will save as a .csv file
	which is compatible with most spreadsheet programs like Excel
